## Migration tools

### Migration Toolkit for Containers

The Migration Toolkit for Containers (MTC) migrates an application workload, including  Kubernetes resources, data, and images, from an OpenShift 3 source cluster to an OpenShift 4 target cluster.

MTC performs the migration in two stages:

1. The application workload is backed up from the source cluster to object storage.
2. The application workload is restored to the target cluster from object storage.

**Migrating Kubernetes resources**

MTC migrates all namespaced resources, including Custom Resources. MTC can dynamically discover all the API resources in each referenced namespace.

MTC migrates some cluster-scoped resources. If a namespaced resource references a cluster-scoped resource, it is migrated. Migratable resources include persistent volumes (PVs) bound to a persistent volume claim, cluster role bindings, and security context constraints.

**Migrating persistent volume data**

MTC has two options for migrating persistent volume data:

* **Move**: The PV definition is moved from the source cluster to the target cluster without touching the data. This is the fastest option.

* **Copy**: MTC copies either a *snapshot* or the *file system* of the PV.
  
See [PV move](./running-the-migration.md#pv-move) and [PV copy](./running-the-migration.md#pv-move) for requirements and details.

**Migrating internal images**

Internal images created by S2I builds are migrated. Each ImageStream reference in a given namespace is copied to the registry of the target cluster.

#### When to use MTC

Ideally, you could migrate an application from one cluster to another by redeploying the application from a pipeline and perhaps copying the persistent volume data.  

However, this might not be possible in the real world. A running application on the cluster might experience unforeseen changes and, over a period of time, drift away from the initial deploy. MTC can handle scenarios where you are not certain what your namespace contains and you want to migrate all its contents to a new cluster.

If you can redeploy your application from pipeline, that is the best option. If not, you should use MTC.

### Upstream migration tools

You can migrate PVs with [`pvc-migrate`](https://github.com/konveyor/pvc-migrate) or images with [`imagestream-migrate`](https://github.com/konveyor/imagestream-migrate).

These upstream tools offer advantages for large-scale migrations similar to the following example:

* ~50+ ImageStreams per namespace
* Multiple ~100GB+ persistent volumes

The tools are smaller and more focused. They are based on Ansible playbooks, Python code snippets, [Rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/), and [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo), which simplifies customization and debugging. Their performance is better than MTC.

#### Comparison of MTC and upstream tools

| | MTC  | Upstream tools |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| **Processing** |Serial processing.<br><br> MTC processes one migration plan at a time, one backup/restore operation at a time. (MTC plans to support parallel execution in the future. See [velero-487](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues/487).)  |Parallel processing.<br><br> `imagestream-migrate` can perform parallel image migrations. |
| **Copying** |Two copy processes.<br><br> Backup and restore.  |Single copy process. |
| **Debugging** |Challenging.<br><br> A migration error can span different clusters, namespaces, and controller logs.   |Relatively easy. <br><br>Tools are based on Ansible and Python. |
| **Customization** |Difficult. <br><br>Requires updating the Golang code, recompiling, and then updating the MTC Operator to deliver the new version. |Relatively easy. <br><br>Tools are based on Ansible and Python.  |

#### Combining MTC and upstream tools

You can combine upstream tools and MTC for migration in a process that resembles the following procedure.

*Prerequisites*

* Direct network connection between the source and target clusters. A process running on each node of the source cluster must be able to connect to an exposed route on the target cluster.
* The host running `pvc-migrate` has root access to each node of the source cluster.
* PVs are being migrated from OpenShift Container Storage 3 to 4. `pvc-migrate` does not support other storage providers.

*Procedure*

1. Configure MTC to omit PVs and/or images from the migration plan by setting the following parameters in the Migration Controller manifest:
  ```
  disable_image_migration: true
  disable_pv_migration: true
  ```
2. Migrate the application workload with MTC.

3. Run `pvc-migrate` to migrate PVs and/or `imagestream-migrate` to migrate images.

## Migration environment considerations

### OpenShift 3

The following considerations apply to the OpenShift 3 source environment.

#### TLS

* Termination types
  * Passthrough
  * Edge
    * Minimal amount as this is managed by the cluster by default
  * Re-encryption
    * Where does the certificate originate?
    * Corporate CA
    * Self-signed certificates
  * Update to routes
* CA certificates
  * Reading PEM files
  * Embedded certificates

#### Routing

* Traffic traversal between clusters

#### External dependencies

* Ingress/Egress

#### Images

* Migrating the internal image registry
* Prune the image registry before migration
* TBD: unknown blob error in registry (perhaps related to NFS)

#### Storage

* MTC requires an intermediate object storage as a replication repository.
* Source and target clusters must have full access to the replication repository.
* TBD: Velero does not over-write objects in source environment. Link to Velero documentation.

### OpenShift 4

The following considerations apply to the OpenShift 4 target environment:

* Creating namespaces before migration might cause quota changes.

## Migration strategies
This section describes migration strategies for stateless applications.

Each migration strategy has the following attributes:

* Applications are deployed on the 4.x cluster.
* If necessary, the 4.x router default certificate includes the 3.x wildcard SAN.
* Each application adds an additional route with the 3.x host name.

### "Big Bang" migration

At migration, the 3.x wildcard DNS record is changed to point to the 4.x router virtual IP address (VIP).

![BigBang](https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-migration-best-practices/raw/master/images/migration-strategy-bigbang.png)

### Individual migration

* Optional: The route with the 3.x host name contains an appropriate certificate.

At migration, a new record is created for each application with the 3.x FQDN/host name pointing to the 4.x router VIP. This record takes precedence over the 3.x wildcard DNS record.

![Individual](https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-migration-best-practices/raw/master/images/migration-strategy-individual.png)

### Individual, canary-style migration

* Optional: The route with the 3.x host name contains an appropriate certificate.

A VIP/proxy with two backends, the 3.x router VIP and the 4.x router VIP, is created for each application.

At migration, a new record is created for each application with the 3.x FQDN/host name pointing to the VIP/proxy. This record takes precedence over the 3.x wildcard DNS record.

The proxy entry for the application is configured to route `X`% of the traffic to the 3.x router VIP and (100-`X`)% of the traffic to the 4.x VIP.

`X` is gradually moved from `100` to `0`.

![Canary](https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-migration-best-practices/raw/master/images/migration-strategy-canary.png)

### Individual, audience-based migration

* Optional: The route with the 3.x host name contains an appropriate certificate.

A VIP/proxy with two backends, the 3.x router VIP and the 4.x router VIP, is created for each application.

At migration, a new record is created for each application with the 3.x FQDN/host name pointing to the VIP/proxy. This record takes precedence over the 3.x wildcard DNS record.

The proxy entry for the application is configured to route traffic matching a given header pattern, for example, test customers, to the 4.x router VIP and the rest of the traffic to the 3.x VIP.

Traffic is moved to the 4.x VIP in waves until all the traffic is on the 4.x VIP.
